# Git Resource

Tracks the commits in a [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.


## Source Configuration

* `uri`: *Required.* The location of the repository.

* `branch`: *Required.* The branch to track.

* `private_key`: *Optional.* Private key to use when pulling/pushing.
    Example:
    ```
    private_key: |
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAtCS10/f7W7lkQaSgD/mVeaSOvSF9ql4hf/zfMwfVGgHWjj+W
      <Lots more text>
      DWiJL+OFeg9kawcUL6hQ8JeXPhlImG6RTUffma9+iGQyyBMCGd1l
      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

* `paths`: *Optional.* If specified (as a list of glob patterns), only changes
  to the specified files will yield new versions.

* `ignore_paths`: *Optional.* The inverse of `paths`; changes to the specified
  files are ignored.

### Example

Resource configuration for a private repo:

``` yaml
resources:
- name: source-code
  type: git
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:concourse/git-resource.git
    branch: master
    private_key: |
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAtCS10/f7W7lkQaSgD/mVeaSOvSF9ql4hf/zfMwfVGgHWjj+W
      <Lots more text>
      DWiJL+OFeg9kawcUL6hQ8JeXPhlImG6RTUffma9+iGQyyBMCGd1l
      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Fetching a repo with only 100 commits of history:

``` yaml
- get: source-code
  params: {depth: 100}
```

Pushing local commits to the repo:

``` yaml
- get: some-other-repo
- put: source-code
  params: {repository: some-other-repo}
```


## Behavior

### `check`: Check for new commits.

The repository is cloned (or pulled if already present), and any commits
made after the given version are returned. If no version is given, the ref
for `HEAD` is returned.

Any commits that contain the string `[ci skip]` will be ignored. This
allows you to commit to your repository without triggering a new version.

### `in`: Clone the repository, at the given ref.

Clones the repository to the destination, and locks it down to a given ref.
Returns the resulting ref as the version.

Submodules are initialized and updated recursively.


#### Parameters

* `depth`: *Optional.* If a positive integer is given, *shallow* clone the
  repository using the `--depth` option.

* `submodules`: *Optional.* If `none`, submodules will not be
  fetched. If specified as a list of paths, only the given paths will be
  fetched. If not specified, or if `all` is explicitly specified, all
  submodules are fetched.


### `out`: Push to a repository.

Push the checked-out reference to the source's URI and branch. All tags are
also pushed to the source. If a fast-forward for the branch is not possible
and the `rebase` parameter is not provided, the push will fail.

#### Parameters

* `repository`: *Required.* The path of the repository to push to the source.

* `rebase`: *Optional.* If pushing fails with non-fast-forward, continuously
  attempt rebasing and pushing.

* `tag`: *Optional* If this is set then HEAD will be tagged. The value should be
  a path to a file containing the name of the tag.

* `only_tag`: *Optional* When set to 'true' push only the tags of a repo.

* `tag_prefix`: *Optional.* If specified, the tag read from the file will be
prepended with this string. This is useful for adding `v` in front of
version numbers.
